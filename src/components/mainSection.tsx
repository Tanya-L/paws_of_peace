            We support animal sterilization and vaccination projects in Ukraine,
            and also help provide homeless and abandoned animals with food and
            medical treatment. Join Paws of Peace in supporting animal shelters
            in Ukraine by donating pet food, pet care products, or money to help

          <h3>About Paws of Peace</h3>
          <div className="text-start">
            We are a nonprofit organization based in Sweden dedicated to making
            a positive impact on animal welfare in Ukraine. Our primary focus is
            on collecting donations, including financial support, pet food, and
            pet care products, which are then sent to Ukraine. Our goal is to
            distribute these donations among animal shelters in Ukraine that are
            in need of assistance. Our team works tirelessly to ensure that the
            donations we receive are utilized in the most effective manner
            possible. We carefully evaluate the needs of the shelters and strive
            to allocate resources where they will have the greatest impact. At
            the core of our mission is the belief that every animal deserves a
            safe and loving home. We are passionately committed to turning this
            belief into a reality. Together, we can make a significant
            difference in the lives of these animals.
