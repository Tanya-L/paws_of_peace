            <h3>About Paws of Peace</h3>
            <div className="text-start">
              We are a nonprofit organization based in Sweden dedicated to
              making a positive impact on animal welfare in Ukraine. Our primary
              focus is on collecting donations, including financial support, pet
              food, and pet care products, which are then sent to Ukraine. Our
              goal is to distribute these donations among animal shelters in
              Ukraine that are in need of assistance. Our team works tirelessly
              to ensure that the donations we receive are utilized in the most
              effective manner possible. We carefully evaluate the needs of the
              shelters and strive to allocate resources where they will have the
              greatest impact. At the core of our mission is the belief that
              every animal deserves a safe and loving home. We are passionately
              committed to turning this belief into a reality. Together, we can
              make a significant difference in the lives of these animals.
